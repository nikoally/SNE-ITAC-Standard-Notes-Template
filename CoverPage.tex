\section*{Preamble}

This is a collection of worksheets intended to streamline onsite SNE-ITAC assessments, improve data collection, and increase involvement and responsibility of newer members. They are optimized for both the most common recommendations by our center and on a national level. The information that these worksheets is not comprehensive for all recommendations, but should provide a solid foundation for several recommendations. Users should consult the \textbf{SNE-ITAC Recommendation Manual} for information regarding exactly what information is needed for each recommendation. 

For some worksheets, such as those for air compressors, boilers, and chillers, multiple copies may be needed for any given assessment. Thus, multiple copies should be brought to each assessment. 

This collection of worksheets is designed for use either digitally, on an iPad or similar device, or printed in hard copy form.
